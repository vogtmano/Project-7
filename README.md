# Project 7 - Whitehouse Petitions

Days 33-35 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 33: UITabBarController, Data, Codable, and parsing JSON.

Day 34: Injecting HTML into a web view, UIStoryboard, loadHTMLString, and didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, and adding tabs to a tab bar controller in code.

## Challenges

Day 35:

1. Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.
2. Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I’ve included some hints below if you get stuck.
3. Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.
